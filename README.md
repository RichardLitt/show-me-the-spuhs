# Show Me The Spuhs

This script is meant to show you all spuhs, slashes, or hybrids which are higher in the taxonomy tree than any taxon leaves you've previously identified. In short, it is mean to answer: "what spuhs could I use?"

Writing it is somewhat difficult, because the eBird taxonomy is not three dimensional.

- It's not obvious if there are slashes or subspecies for a given species.
- It's not clear which generic spuh(s) match a given species.
- It's not clear if any genus should have a corresponding spuh in the same family.
- It's not clear if any genus should have a corresponding spuh in the same order.

The script will need to check each of these before listing all spuhs, slashes, or hybrids that might match a given observed species. Right now, it doesn't do that well, but I am tired of working so I am stopping.
